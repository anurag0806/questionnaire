# questionnaire
This is a project to create a questionnaire in HTML and  based on the answers derieve a conclusion. An example would be to answer a few questions to determine which "one piece" character you are.

* The idea is to have this configurable
* Keep the questions, answers and conclusion in a separate JSON 
* Keep HTML and JQuery separate from the data.

This project is mainly for learning. Let's see how this goes.
